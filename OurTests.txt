Room Labels:
	We chose to use Coolbaugh and Engineering Hall because they appear first and last in the file, respectively.
	We chose to use the Student Center and Brown because they appear at the top and bottom of the board.
	We chose to use the Geology Museum because it appears in a corner that is not first or last in the file.
	
Board Dimensions:
	We tested that getNumRows() returns 26, since we have 26 rows on our board.
	We tested that getNumColumns() returns 23, since we have 23 columns on our board.
	
Four Door Directions:
	We chose cell (4,2) because it faces left into Coolbaugh and is close to the top and corner.
	We chose cell (13, 1) because it faces up into Hill and is close to an edge.
	We chose cell (3,8) because it faces right into Brown and is next to another door cell.
	We chose cell (13, 2) because it faces down into Marquez and is next to another door cell.
	We chose cell (5, 7) as a random walkway cell to check that walkways aren't considered as doors.
	
Test Number of Doorways:
	We're counting all of the doors on the board and checking that we count 19 doors, which is how many doors are on our game board.
